## Introduction
In today's fast-paced software development world, the ability to quickly and efficiently test new features is a game-changer for teams aiming to maintain a competitive edge. Preview Environments, also known as Ephemeral Environments, serve as the critical testing grounds for new features, bug fixes, and updates before they are integrated into the main codebase. These environments are crafted on-demand to validate specific git branches, providing a transient yet powerful platform for thorough pre-merge testing.

`"Don't merge until you preview" - with Veyoze, ensure that excellence is the standard, not the exception.`

### The Challenge

While Preview Environments are indispensable in modern DevOps, their setup and maintenance pose a significant challenge. Traditionally, the creation of these environments has been a manual, time-consuming task, often requiring complex orchestration of resources. The process can introduce delays in testing, bottlenecks in deployment, and ultimately hinders the development velocity. Moreover, maintaining the lifecycle of these environments in sync with pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs) demands constant attention and can strain the resources of any software team.

### The Veyoze Solution

Enter Veyoze, the CLI tool designed to seamlessly automate the provisioning of Preview Environments behind the scenes of Laravel Forge Server Manager. Veyoze stands at the forefront of DevOps innovation, offering a streamlined process to generate and manage ephemeral environments effectively. With Veyoze, the creation, updating, and deletion of Preview Environments are triggered automatically in response to PRs or MRs, mirroring the lifecycle of the code changes they represent.

#### How Veyoze Enhances Development Workflows:

- **Automated Provisioning**: Veyoze automates the setup of Preview Environments, enabling your team to focus on building and testing rather than configuration and deployment.
- **Speed and Efficiency**: By reducing the time required to test new features, Veyoze empowers teams to increase their development velocity significantly.
- **Quality Assurance**: Veyoze's pre-merge testing capabilities ensure that every feature is rigorously evaluated in a production-like setting, minimizing the risk of post-merge issues.
- **Scalability**: With Veyoze, teams can scale their testing efforts without a corresponding increase in overhead or complexity.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: By providing isolated environments for each feature, Veyoze facilitates better collaboration across developers, testers, product teams, and stakeholders.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Veyoze ensures no remnants of test environments after PRs are merged or closed.

### Embracing the "Shift Left" Philosophy

Veyoze embodies the principle of "shifting left" in the software development lifecycle. By shifting testing to the earliest stages possible, Veyoze acts as a quality gate, ensuring that only the most robust features reach your main branch. This proactive approach to quality assurance aligns with the DevOps philosophy of continuous integration and delivery, setting a new standard for code review and quality control.

### The Future of DevOps

As the demand for faster and more reliable deployment cycles grows, tools like Veyoze represent the next step in the evolution of DevOps. It's not just about bringing Web Applications, or APIs into the age of real-time previewing; it's about transforming the entire development process into a more efficient, effective, and error-free journey. With Veyoze, experience the "holy grail" of DevOps, where every pull request paves the way for a smoother, faster, and more secure path to production.

### Veyoze could be the game-changer for your team if you recognize these scenarios:

1. **Fast Shipping Needs**: Your business's success depends on rapid feature deployment. Veyoze expedites this, helping you lead the market.

2. **Stalled Releases**: Commits with bugs are delaying your releases. Veyoze's isolated preview environments mean you can test without disrupting the main branch.

3. **Slow PR/MR Merges**: If merging changes is a slow process, Veyoze's automation can help you review and integrate faster.

4. **Heavy Local Testing**: If your lead is constantly testing branches locally, Veyoze automates this process, freeing up their valuable time.

5. **Development Delays**: Frequent "Code Freezes" indicate fear of instability. Veyoze lets you test fearlessly, potentially reducing or eliminating freezes.

6. **Shared Environment Clogs**: If you're juggling a shared test environment among multiple developers, Veyoze's on-demand environments offer each developer their own testing space.

7. **Frontend Only Previews**: Have frontend previews but no backend? Veyoze provides backend preview environments too.

8. **Test Queue Bottlenecks**: Long waits for automated tests? Veyoze‚Äôs parallel testing environments cut down the queue time.

9. **Team Collaboration Hurdles**: If enhancing collaboration across your team is a goal, Veyoze's shared review spaces promote real-time, iterative feedback.

10. **POC Environment Challenges**: Need to show off a new feature but setting up a demo is tough? Veyoze makes it easy to provision temporary environments.

11. **Ops Team Bottlenecks**: Relying on Ops for environment setups? Veyoze gives your team the independence to create environments on-the-fly.

Short and simple, Veyoze streamlines your development and testing processes, ensuring that your team stays agile and productive.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
Before diving in, ensure you have:

- An [app server on Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/servers/types.html#app-servers).
- A Forge [API token](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/1.0/accounts/api.html#create-api-token).

### Setup and Deploy

To utilize Veyoze CLI on pull requests, integrate a GitHub action workflow that activates on PR events. Begin by creating a workflow named `preview-provision.yml`:

```yml
name: preview-provision
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened, ready_for_review]
jobs:
  veyoze-provision:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: kirschbaumdevelopment/laravel-test-runner:8.1
    steps:
        - name: Install Veyoze
          run: composer global require mehrancodes/veyoze -q
        - name: Start Provisioning
          env:
              FORGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FORGE_TOKEN }}
              FORGE_SERVER: ${{ secrets.FORGE_SERVER }}
              FORGE_GIT_REPOSITORY: ${{ github.repository }}
              FORGE_GIT_BRANCH: ${{ github.head_ref }}
              FORGE_DOMAIN: veyoze.com
          run: veyoze provision
```

This workflow:

1. Listens for specific GitHub action events: opened, edited, reopened, ready_for_review
2. Sets up the workflow container and installs Veyoze.
3. Uses environment keys for Veyoze configuration.
4. Generates a URL like **plt-123-add-new-feature.veyoze.com** upon running the `veyoze provision` command.

### Destroy the Site

To dismantle the site after a PR is merged or closed, introduce a new workflow to execute the `veyoze teardown` command. Create a workflow named `preview-teardown.yml`:

```yml
name: preview-teardown
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
jobs:
  veyoze-teardown:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: kirschbaumdevelopment/laravel-test-runner:8.1
    steps:
        - name: Install Veyoze
          run: composer global require mehrancodes/veyoze -q
        - name: Start Teardown
          env:
              FORGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FORGE_TOKEN }}
              FORGE_SERVER: ${{ secrets.FORGE_SERVER }}
              FORGE_GIT_REPOSITORY: ${{ github.repository }}
              FORGE_GIT_BRANCH: ${{ github.head_ref }}
              FORGE_DOMAIN: veyoze.com
          run: veyoze teardown
```

# Configuration

Veyoze utilizes environment keys similar to a Laravel application, offering flexibility and the potential for powerful extensions over time.

#### `FORGE_TOKEN` (required)
This key holds your Forge API token, enabling Veyoze to communicate with Laravel Forge for site creation and resource management. **Always store this value as an encrypted secret; avoid pasting it directly into your workflow file.**

#### `FORGE_SERVER` (required)
Specify the server where Veyoze should create and deploy a site.  The value to use here is the Forge "Server ID" for the target server.  Examples: 723019, 68342, etc.

#### `FORGE_GIT_REPOSITORY` (required)
Indicate the Git repository name, such as 'mehrancodes/veyoze'.

#### `FORGE_GIT_BRANCH` (required)
Provide the Git repository branch name, for instance, 'add-new-feature'.

#### `FORGE_DOMAIN` (required)
Define the website's domain name. Acceptable formats include 'veyoze.com' or 'api.veyoze.com'.

#### `FORGE_GIT_PROVIDER`
Identify the Git service provider. Options include GitHub, GitLab, etc., with 'github' as the default. Refer to the [Forge API documentation](https://forge.laravel.com/api-documentation#install-new) for more details.

#### `FORGE_SUBDOMAIN_PATTERN`
Veyoze constructs the site's subdomain based on your branch name. If your branch name follows a format like **YOUR_TEAM_SHORT_NAME-TICKET_ID** (e.g., **apt-123-added-new-feature**), you can employ a [regex pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to abbreviate your subdomain:

```shell
FORGE_SUBDOMAIN_PATTERN: /^[a-z]{1,3}-(\d{1,4})/i
```

#### `FORGE_DEPLOY_SCRIPT`
By setting the [Forge Deploy Script](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/sites/deployments.html#deploy-script) environment key, you can seamlessly relay your custom bash deploy script to your new Forge site before project deployment. You can provide it directly or via a [GitHub action variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables) for improved workflow readability. Here's a basic deploy script example:

```shell
FORGE_DEPLOY_SCRIPT: "cd $FORGE_SITE_PATH; git pull origin $FORGE_SITE_BRANCH; composer install; etc..."
```

For extensive deploy scripts, consider using an action variable or secret:

```shell
# Store the script in a variable, e.g., LARAVEL_DEPLOY_SCRIPTS:
cd $FORGE_SITE_PATH
git pull origin $FORGE_SITE_BRANCH
composer install

# Then reference it like this:
FORGE_DEPLOY_SCRIPT: ${{ vars.LARAVEL_DEPLOY_SCRIPTS }}
```

#### `FORGE_ENV_KEYS`
Employ this key to introduce or update your project's custom environment keys, separated by ';':

```bash
FORGE_ENV_KEYS="GOOGLE_API=${{secrets.APP_NAME}}; SMS_API=${{secrets.SMS_API}}"
```

Alternatively, as mentioned in the deploy script section, utilize a secret key for easier management:

```shell
FORGE_ENV_KEYS: ${{ secrets.LARAVEL_ENV_KEYS }}
```

#### `FORGE_NGINX_TEMPLATE`
This key allows you to specify a custom [Nginx configuration](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/servers/nginx-templates.html) template. This is useful when you need to tweak the default Nginx settings to cater to specific requirements of your application.

#### `FORGE_NGINX_SUBSTITUTE`
Define key=value pairs to customize the Nginx template. This is particularly handy when you need to automatically set values inside your Nginx template, such as proxying your Nuxt.js app to a specific port. An example value might be: 'NUXT_PORT=1234; NEXT_PORT=7542'.

#### `FORGE_PHP_VERSION`
Specify the desired PHP version for your application. The default is 'php82', but you can set it to other supported versions installed on your server as per your application's requirements.

#### `FORGE_PROJECT_TYPE`
Indicate the [type of the project](https://forge.laravel.com/api-documentation#create-site). The default is 'php', but depending on your application's stack, you might need to specify a different type.

#### `FORGE_SITE_ISOLATION`
A flag to determine if [user isolation](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/sites/user-isolation.html) is required. By default, it's set to false.

#### `FORGE_JOB_SCHEDULER`
This flag indicates whether a job scheduler, like Laravel's task scheduler, is needed. By default, it's set to false.

#### `FORGE_AUTO_SOURCE_REQUIRED`
A flag to determine if environment variables should be auto-sourced during deployment. By default, it's set to false. Enable this if your deployment process requires environment variables to be sourced automatically.

#### `FORGE_DB_CREATION_REQUIRED`
Indicate if a database should be automatically created during the provisioning process. By default, it's set to false.

#### `FORGE_SSL_REQUIRED`
This flag indicates whether SSL certification should be enabled for the site. While the default setting is false, enabling this ensures your site is served securely over HTTPS.

**Note**: If you enable this, ensure you've added [a wildcard subdomain DNS record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record) pointing to your Forge server.

#### `FORGE_QUICK_DEPLOY`
This flag allows you to toggle the [Quick Deploy](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/sites/deployments.html#deploy-script) feature. By default, it's set to false.

**Caution**: If you intend to enable this feature on your site, ensure the provision workflow isn't triggered.

I've made the descriptions more concise and clear, and added emphasis where needed for clarity.

#### `FORGE_WAIT_ON_SSL`
A flag to pause the provisioning process until the SSL setup completes. By default, it's set to true, ensuring that the provisioning doesn't proceed until the SSL is fully set up.

#### `FORGE_WAIT_ON_DEPLOY`
This flag pauses the provisioning process until the site deployment completes. By default, it's true, ensuring a smooth and complete deployment before any subsequent steps.

#### `FORGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
This flag indicates how much time should be allowed for the deployment process. Defaults to 180 seconds.

#### `GIT_PR_COMMENTS`
This flag indicates if you would like to receive the site information in your pull request as a comment when provision is done. Defaults to false.

You also need to set the `GIT_TOKEN` and `GIT_ISSUE_NUMBER` so this feature being able to work.

#### `GIT_TOKEN`
This flag is required in order to post a comment on the pull request. You may assign `${{ github.token }}` to it as the GitHub API token. 

#### `GIT_ISSUE_NUMBER`
This flag is required in order to post a comment on the pull request. You may assign `${{ github.event.number }}` to it as the GitHub pull request number.

## Acknowledgments

**Q: Is it secure to use sensitive data like API tokens in our workflow?**

**A:** Yes, when passed securely. We use [GitHub actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) to safely pass the Forge token and server ID.

**Q: Can we get a shorter link for long branch names?**

**A:** Absolutely! By configuring the [Subdomain Pattern](https://github.com/mehrancodes/veyoze#forge_subdomain_pattern) you can shorten the domain, e.g., **plt-123.veyoze.com**.

**Q: Why use environment keys for configuration instead of command arguments?**

**A:** We have around 20 configurations and more planned. Using environment keys keeps things organized. However, we're open to suggestions!

**Q: How can we control the conditions under which this workflow runs?**

**A:** Check our [veyoze-laravel-sample workflow](https://github.com/mehrancodes/veyoze-laravel-sample/blob/92fce07b6b63bf665ad2063db7f2ad00fa9f3f31/.github/workflows/pr-preview-provision.yml#L7). It specifies conditions like the PR not being a draft or the PR title containing `[veyoze]`.

**Q: Is there a standalone build for Veyoze CLI?**

**A:** Yes! Grab the latest build [from the releases page](https://github.com/mehrancodes/veyoze/releases). It's quicker to set up and highly recommended.
